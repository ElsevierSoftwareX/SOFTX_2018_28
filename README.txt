Bedforms-ATM V1.1 is presented as a free MATLAB software and comprises the following applications: [1] Bed forms wavelet
analysis, [2] Power Hovmoller analysis, [3] Bed forms multiscale discrimination, and [4] Three-dimensionality analysis.

Bedforms-ATM is intended to standardize the scale-based discrimination of bed forms. It was developed as a joint
collaboration between the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Perú, PUCP); the
University of Technology and Engineering (Universidad de Ingeniera y Tecnologa), Peru; and the Technische Universitat
Braunschweig, Germany.

Download all the codes from APPLINK and run them from MATLAB. Keep in mind that Bedforms ATM had been developed in MATLAB
2015a, so previous versions of MATLAB could not execute some functions.

Please read the User Manual which is distributed along with this file before use the programs. An instructional video can
be found at the post link VIDEOLINK.
